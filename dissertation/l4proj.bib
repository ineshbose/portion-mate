	abstract = {In this study, we analyzed usages behaviors of 53,825 active users from 12 countries in a mobile app called “English Practice.” The data indicated that the app was used most often in the evening from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m., and especially midweek, with less use at weekends and on Mondays. Learners used the app for about 5 minutes each session and averaged 10 uses before uninstalling it. The data also provided evidence that there were differences in each country. From the findings, it is suggested that (a) learning tasks be simplified and content reduced for each session, (b) announcements not be made in the early morning or on the weekend as these are easily overlooked, and (c) as user behavior in each country is different, each group be better understood when delivering learning content and designing the app interface. Finally, we concluded that publishing apps in the app store can provide valuable data regarding app users’ behaviors.},
