# Development

The application was developed during the academic year 2021-22 at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) as part of [Level 4 Individual Project](https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=COMPSCI4025P) by student [Inesh Bose](https://inesh.xyz/) under the supervision of [Dr. Oana Andrei](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~oandrei/).

The project makes use of best practices where possible, including issue-branching, code linting, automation with pipelines, etc. Loads of research has also gone into developing this, with credits and appreciation to all support and inspiration from developers on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [Reddit](https://reddit.com/), programming [Discord](https://discord.com/) servers, and [many many open source projects](https://github.com/). Many acknowledgements also go to my previous/current employers that have helped me realise professional development. Notably, this includes [New Verve Consulting](https://newverveconsulting.com/) and [Glasgow University Software Service (GUSS)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/industry/glasgowuniversitysoftwareserviceguss/).

Regular meetings were scheduled with the supervisor. All information can be found on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ineshbose/portion-mate/).
