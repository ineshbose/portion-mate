  <h3 align="center">Portion Mate</h3>
  <h5 align="center">Evaluation Survey</h5>
</p>
</div>

The aim of this experiment is to investigate the scale of usability for an application that is designed for people, such as yourself, to log their food intake. As you could understand, this may require commitment, but this experiment should take no more than 30 minutes. Before you decide whether you want to take part, it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what your participation will involve. You should only participate if you want to; choosing not to take part will not disadvantage you in any way, and you are welcome to withdraw at any time. If you do so, then it will not be possible for you to be debriefed about the purposes of the experiment. Please take time to read the following information carefully and ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. For questions, you can send an email to Inesh Bose: 2504266b@student.gla.ac.uk

The application "Portion Mate" was created as a Level 4 Dissertation Project with the target to help users keep track of their daily portion count from each food group based on the NHS Eatwell Guide (you can read more on <https://portion-mate.readthedocs.io/>). You will see the app in action during this experiment, and in order to evaluate its usability, you will be required to answer this survey. There are three sections in this survey which will also provide further information about the relevance of the questions. You are free to not answer questions that are not required, but the data will help. All responses are anonymous and in compliance with GDPR and the University of Glasgow SoCS Project Ethics.

## Interface

This section would be answered after using the app and focuses on the usability of the application through your experience and journey with the app. The questions here are statements, based on the System Usability Scale, which you can answer on a scale of 1-5 (3 is neutral) going from Strongly disagree and Strongly agree depending on how you feel and agree with the statement. All responses in this section are required.

You are now asked to navigate to the app on your browser (<https://inesh.xyz/portion-mate>) and follow the tasks given below which are not timed or judging your performance, but helping you go through the app itself. You may choose to evaluate the application yourself without these tasks.

1. Create an account, or login if you already have one
2. Log your portion items taken so far in the day
3. Visualise the graphs for the items logged
4. Go to Resources, read about The Eatwell Guide and bookmark it if needed
5. Additionally, add a journal entry about your first meal of the day

## Debrief

With this, the survey ends and you will be debriefed about this experiment.

The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the usability of a daily food portion count tracker application (called Portion Mate). This meant navigating through the pages, interacting with elements, visualisation and appeal. Your responses would help point out and understand any frustrations or problems that might have occurred during your experience.

If you would like to know and see more about this project, everything (including the source code) can be found on this GitHub repository: <https://github.com/ineshbose/portion-mate>. This repository acts as the single source of truth for all information regarding Portion Mate. This would also mean participant feedback and data analysis, therefore if you would like to aid this practice, you can confirm your responses being held in this public repository anonymously. By default, your data will not be public and on the repository if you do not agree. It will help more developers gather insight and refer to data for making better applications for the world in the future.

For more questions and concerns, you can send an email to Inesh Bose: 2504266b@student.gla.ac.uk

### Database Agreement

- [ ] I am OK with my responses being public (but anonymous)
