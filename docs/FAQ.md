# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## How is my data used?

Your data is used only by you and whoever you wish to share it with by yourself (such as a nutritionist). Portion Mate allows you to turn your data into information for your dietary habits.

## How do I customise my app?

You can edit your account information in the settings, and also switch the application theme between light and dark modes.

## How do I add/remove an item?

The red floating action button gives you option to add an item (or a journal entry), and you can remove an item by going into the edit mode on the homepage.

## Can I delete my account?

If you wish to delete your account, you can scroll to the bottom of the settings page. Please know that this action will be irreversible. All your data will be deleted and cannot be recovered.

## Can I copy this project?

Unfortunately, the project is not open-source licensed at the moment - mostly due to the academic nature. The repository is public and available for reference and inspiration.

## Where can I share feedback and thoughts?

Any feedback and suggestion is more than welcome, and you can share them by emailing to [2504266b@student.gla.ac.uk](mailto:2504266b@student.gla.ac.uk).
