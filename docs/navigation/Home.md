- **Carbohydrates**: 6 portions a day
- **Fruits & Vegetables**: 6 portions a day
- **Protein**: 3 portions a day
- **Dairy**: 3 portions a day

These can be removed or changed according to your preferred diet plan, which may also be vegan, dairy-free (lactose intolerance), or an allergy to something. To do so, you can press the edit button on the top right of the screen which would switch to edit view allowing you to change the target for an item, and/or delete or reorder it on the list.
