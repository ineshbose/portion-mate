## Agenda

* Discuss repository setup
* Discuss requirements
* Discuss models


## Notes

The requirements were formalised, however more will come up over the course as the app is being developed. Along with that, an ER diagram was designed to understand how logging will work through a linear three model system. This will be the structure in the backend (and) database through Django. Dr. Andrei was able to confirm access to the repository.

The plan for this week is to start coding and finish due tasks (mostly wireframes).
