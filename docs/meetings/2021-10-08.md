* Discuss initial progress
* Update on [research](#research)
* Share repository information
* Discuss paper log confusions; get actual logs/examples if possible

## Notes

The progress of the application seems certain. The frameworks have been decided to be Django and React Native for backend and frontend respectively, and there will be a slight learning curve. Through the research, some ideas like UI design and elements were discussed. The repository has started get set-up and access should be given to Dr. Andrei through [her GitHub](https://github.com/oanaandrei). Finally, some confusions regarding the paper logs were clarified. The "input table" indicate how many portions are aimed for each day through the number of cells, and each cell should be crossed off. To understand better, an actual log was requested from Dr. Andrei's diary.

As for the current plan, the learning curve should be continued along with the repository setup and working on requirements & wireframes.
