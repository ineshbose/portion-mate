## Agenda

* Short meeting
* Discuss repository setup with pipelines
* Discuss specifications
* Discuss block 2

## Notes

The repository was polished more as issue tracking was promised, therefore coding started with the pipelines rather than the app itself. This was displayed with a demonstration of how issues are linked to card on the automated Kanban Boards, along with issue templates and labels, that would be connected to branches created by automation.

More specifications were formalised - mostly user stories/personas. By now, Block 1 (as devised by Dr. Andrei, and used as a planning period) should be wrapped, and Block 2 has started (setup & development period). The current task is to work on Block 2 tasks, and finish the few remaining Block 1 tasks (wireframes).
