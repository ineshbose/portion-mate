## Meeting Notes

Most of the time in the meeting was consumed by sharing ideas on wireframes. There are some areas that are not detailed enough yet (for example diary & statistics). Dr. Andrei disagrees about dark mode being the better design - choice is essential! The "daily" wording and text seemed to be too repetitive and redundant, and while the `+` and `-` buttons are easy, it does not offer the satisfaction of a tick in a checkbox - that should be incorporated in the wireframes.
