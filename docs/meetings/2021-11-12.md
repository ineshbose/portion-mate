## Meeting Notes

The wireframes are much more improved now - the checkboxes with `+` and `-` were very handy to log additional or remove some for the day as well even though the edit option is provided. Along with that, a Journal entry integrating with the logs is very appreciated. The level of detail in the models were impressive and notes should not be forgotten while compiling dissertation.

The current plan focuses on code mostly, and soon shifting focus on front-end and wrapping [Block 2](https://github.com/ineshbose/portion-mate/projects/2).
